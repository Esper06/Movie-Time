# Movie-Time

## Description

We wanted to find a way to give our users a comfortable, streamlined and efficient way to plan their movie night! Ever spent too long scrolling through Netflix only to be disappointed? Well now you can use our site to plan a movie night for yourself, your friends or your family. All of our members will be able to use the site in order to create a list of all their favourite movies, or movies they planned to watch. The user will be able to **like**, **comment** and **view** trailers of the movies they search.

We took on this task in order to test our skills and further develop our knowledge of node modules and restful APIs. The app allows us to employ all of the skills we have gathered thus far and observe our progression since the last project. Along the way we learned how to use a new npm module **(Flash)**.

## Installation 

In order to install the contents of our app, the user must simply open up the repository in their terminal and enter *'npm i'*. This will proceed to install of the necessary npm packages required for the app to function correctly.

## Usage

The user will first be required to create an account on our site in order to begin searching for their desired movies. After this, the user can use the search bar at the top of their screen to find the movies they may be interested in. After doing so, they will receive a list of potential movies (in the form of buttons) that match their search, which will then lead to another page, allowing that user to watch trailers, like and comment or add it to their list.
