# Movie-Time

## Description

We wanted to find a way to give our users a comfortable, streamlined and efficient way to plan their movie night! Ever spent too long scrolling through Netflix only to be disappointed? Well now you can use our site to plan a movie night for yourself, your friends or your family. All of our members will be able to use the site in order to create a list of all their favourite movies, or movies they planned to watch. The user will be able to **like**, **comment** and **view** trailers of the movies they search.

We took on this task in order to test our skills and further develop our knowledge of node modules and restful APIs. The app allows us to employ all of the skills we have gathered thus far and observe our progression since the last project. Along the way we learned how to use a new npm module **(Flash)**.
